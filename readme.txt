What kind of information can you capture using a form? (List as many as you can) 
    Name, email, phone number, favorite color, profile name, credit card number, address, zip code, apartment number
    school, languages, hair color, least favorite vegetable.
What types of tags can you use to create forms?  
    <form> <div> <label> <input>
What are the benefits/disadvantages of using some tags over others? 
    Certain features are made for each tag. If you want to use those features, using that tag
    makes sense. Sometimes you want to make your own features for a custom tag.
    <Form> is already built for you but you have to work within those parameters.
How do you start to programmatically use the data provided by the user? 
    Within <Form>, you can store the data using <input> type, id, and name. 
    Once the data is collected, it can be used by calling that id or name.
